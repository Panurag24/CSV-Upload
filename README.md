# CSV-upload

CSV-upload is a Node.js web application that allows users to upload CSV files, display a list of uploaded files, and view the data in a table on the front end. The application also includes a search box that can search through the data and display only the matching rows.

## Installation
To run the application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, you can follow these steps to install and run the application:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Panurag24/CSV-Upload`
2. Install Mongodb: 'npm install mongodb'
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can use the application by navigating localhost:3000 in your web browser.

To upload a CSV file, select it using the "Choose File" button, ensuring the delimiter is a comma (','). Uploaded files will be listed; clicking a file name displays its data in a table on the front end. For data exploration, enter a search term in the box â€“ the search spans all columns, showing matching rows. To contribute, fork the repository, make desired changes, and submit a pull request for review. This streamlined process facilitates CSV file uploading, data visualization, and search. It also invites community involvement to enhance project functionality.
